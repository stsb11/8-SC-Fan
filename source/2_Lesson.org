* Using a potentiometer

- A potentiometer is a component we can use in our circuits as potential divider.
- Before you learn about the potentiometer, you need to learn what is meant by a potential divider.

- Open Circuit Wizard and create the circuit shown below. NB. Voltmeters are listed under the test instructions folder.
[[file:img/circuit1.png]]
- Now press play and the three voltmeters should show potential difference across each of the resistors and across the pair of them.
- Because both resistors have the same value, the potential difference supplies by the battery is equally /divided/ across each resistor.
- Now let's change the value of one of the resistors.
[[file:img/circuit2.png]]
- Press play again, and see how the potential differences have changed.

- Can you see a pattern between resistor values and potential difference?

:PROPERTIES:

- If we know the resistor values and the total potential difference provided by the battery, it is easy to work out what the potential differences across each resistor will be.
$$V_{bottom} = \frac{R_{bottom}}{R_{top}+R_{bottom}}.V_{total}$$

- If we want to find V_top then we can just do the following
$$V_{top}=V_{total}-V_{bottom}$$

- Why is this important?
- By changing resistor values we can influence the timing of the 555 timer chip. This will speed up or slow down the time the capacitor takes to charge.
- Set up the circuit as shown below.
[[file:img/555circuit.JPG]]
- Simulate the circuit and then start adjusting the potentiometer. 
- If you hover the arrow over the motor, you can see the rpm of the motor and the current flow. 
- Change the value of the potentiometer and see how it affects the speed and current flow through the motor.

- It would be inconvenient to have to swap in and out resistors to alter the potential difference reaching our 555 chip. This is where a potentiometer comes in handy.
- Imagine you had a length of resistive wire - as shown below.
[[file:img/pot1.jpg]]
- We can consider this wire to be the equivalent of a single resistor.
[[file:img/pot2.jpg]]
- But we can place a third contact point midway along the wire. This now divides it up into two resistors.
[[file:img/pot3.jpg]]
- This then makes it the equivalent to two resistors.
[[file:img/pot4.jpg]]
- Now we can vary the size of the two resistors by moving the third contact point up and down the wire.
[[file:img/pot5.jpg]]
- This is how a potentiometer works. A coil of wire is used and the third contact point is normally moved by rotating a dial.

- Adjust the values C1 and VR1 and write up an explanation as to how the potentiometer and the capacitor affect the LED output.
