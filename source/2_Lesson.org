* Using a potentiometer

- A potentiometer is a component we can use in our circuits as potential divider.
- Before you learn about the potentiometer, you need to learn what is meant by a potential divider.

- Open Circuit Wizard and create the circuit shown below.
[[file:img/circuit1.png]]
- Now press play and the three voltmeters should show potential difference across each of the resistors and across the pair of them.
- Because both resistors have the same value, the potential difference supplies by the battery is equally /divided/ across each resistor.
- Now let's change the value of one of the resistors.
[[file:img/circuit2.png]]
- Press play again, and see how the potential differences have changed.

- Copy and complete the following table.

- Can you see a pattern between resistor values and potential difference?
** Learn It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn

- If we know the resistor values and the total potential difference provided by the battery, it is easy to work out what the potential differences across each resistor will be.
$$V_{bottom} = \frac{R_{bottom}}{R_{top}+R_{bottom}}.V_{total}$$

- If we want to find V_top then we can just do the following
$$V_{top}=V_{total}-V_{bottom}$$

- Why is this important?
- By changing resistor values we can influence the Potential Difference at an analogue input of a GENIE chip.
- Set up the circuit as shown below, and then create the corresponding flowchart. (Make sure you use a =GENIE C08=)
[[file:img/circuit3.png]]
[[file:img/circuit4.png]]
- Simulate the circuit and then choose =View the analogue sensor readings= from the menu on the right.
[[file:img/circuit5.png]]
- The flowchart is setup so that the LED will turn on when the GENIE analogue sensor detects a value of 100.
- Now change the value of one of the resistors. Keep tweaking it until the LED comes on.
** Badge It - Gold
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Look at the following flowchart.
[[file:img/circuit6.png]]
- What do you think the effect of changing the resistor values will be? Try out the flowchart if you can't figure it out. /(You can create the =A=A1/50= using the =Expr= block)/
- In your own words describe what the program does.

- It would be inconvenient to have to swap in and out resistors to alter the potential difference reaching our GENIE chip. This is where a potentiometer comes in handy.
- Imagine you had a length of resistive wire - as shown below.
[[file:img/pot1.jpg]]
- We can consider this wire to be the equivalent of a single resistor.
[[file:img/pot2.jpg]]
- But we can place a third contact point midway along the wire. This now divides it up into two resistors.
[[file:img/pot3.jpg]]
- This then makes it the equivalent to two resistors.
[[file:img/pot4.jpg]]
- Now we can vary the size of the two resistors by moving the third contact point up and down the wire.
[[file:img/pot5.jpg]]
- This is how a potentiometer works. A coil of wire is used and the third contact point is normally moved by rotating a dial.

- Let's place a potentiometer into our circuit.
[[file:img/circuit7.png]]
- Simulate the circuit and adjust the potentiometer to see how it effects the LED.

:END:
- Create a circuit with a GENIE CO8 with three outputs that connect to LEDs.
- An analogue input should connect to a potentiometer.
- Now write a program that sets the number of LEDs that are on is determined by the potentiometer.
